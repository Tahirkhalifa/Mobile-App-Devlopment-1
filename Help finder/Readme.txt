Group Members: Tahir Khalifa, Abhi Jhaveri, Mohmmadazhar Khalifa

This is my first progress report for our app "Help Finder"
For this week we were able to add in a login screen where user can enter their username and password ibn thier respective fileds.
If the click on login button it takes them to next activity which is the searchbar. We as a group are still working on it

The workload for this week, I felt was evenly distributed. Abhi and Azhar were focused on doing the login screen and getting the buttons
to work and also linking them to the right activity. I was focused on the appereance of the app such as background, text color, size and
making sure the color theam was up to our standards. However, this roles are subjected to change for next week.
